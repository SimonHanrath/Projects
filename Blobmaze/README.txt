The slime mold species Physarum polycephalum (also called The Blob) is a fascinating or-
ganism. Slime molds are neither animals, nor plants, nor fungi. They consist of a single cell,
which can extend over several square meters. Despite their supposedly primitive existence
the species mentioned is particularly known for growing “intelligently” in search of food.
