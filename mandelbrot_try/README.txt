This is a graphical representation of the Mandelbrot set. It consists of complex numbers that all meet a certain criterion. Therefore, the Mandelbrot set is represented in a "complex plane": the x-axis corresponds to the real part of a complex number; the y-axis is the imaginary part.

One goes through many points in sequence within the complex plane and checks whether they are within the Mandelbrot set. So there are only two types of points for the time being: One point is not in the set and is not colored. The others are within the set and are given the color black, for example.

This script draws the Mandelbrot set. It's not very optimized so it's a rough rendering.
